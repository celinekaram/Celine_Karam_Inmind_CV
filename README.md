This repository contains a collection of code snippets and examples created during the Inmind Academy Machine Learning Track.

#### Prerequisites
* Python
* PyTorch
* OpenCV
* Albumentations

### Session 1

**Data Augmentation** using Albumentations

**Custom Module Subclass**

**CNN** convolutional neural network architecture based on LeNet5

### Session 2

**YOLO V1** object detection architecture as described in the original paper.
* The model uses a combination of convolutional and pooling layers for feature extraction.

**Note:** This repository provides code snippets and examples for educational purposes. It might not be a complete, standalone project.
